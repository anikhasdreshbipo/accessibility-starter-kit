# Accessibility & Inclusivity Starter Kit

Welcome to the **Accessibility & Inclusivity Starter Kit**—a practical, open‑source resource designed for business leaders, managers, and anyone who wants to build a more accessible and inclusive workplace.

- **Adopt** assistive technologies (e.g., speech recognition, adjustable seating).
- **Craft** inclusive policies that empower every employee.

## What’s Inside
